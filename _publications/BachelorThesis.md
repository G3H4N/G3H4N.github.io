In the decades since, the rapid progress of light-emitting diode (LED) has brought vast possibilities to the world across variety industries, in which indoor lighting is one of the primary applications. As the advancement of LED technology, the occupant comfort has been increasingly demanded. For improving usersâ€™ perception of the indoor light, this project uses a MPLAB starter kit for PIC24F family microcontroller to build up a light control system. This system has completed the task of acquiring data from environmental temperature and ambient light and translating this data into control signals. With these signals the system is capable to adjust the luminance and colour temperature of the light emitted from a tenable-white LED device. In the future, this system still has room for improvement, and the developer will keep learning in this area further and deeper.
