I am a PhD candidate at [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn).

I am interested in the overlap of machine learning and security, which includes the security evaluation of machine learning systems, and the application of machine learning techniques in security related domains. Specifically, my recent researches concern on the robustness and privacy of machine learning systems and have applied deep learning technique to message hiding.

Since September 2017, I have been a PhD candidate supervised by Prof. Shanqing Guo at [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn), China. Prior to that, I obtained my master degree at [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk), UK. I completed my undergraduate study at [Shandong University (Weihai)](https://www.wh.sdu.edu.cn), China, with a one-year visit to [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk), UK.
